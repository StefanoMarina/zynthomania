# Installing step-by-step

Most of the installing procedure is based on [Lucidbeaming's guide](https://lucidbeaming.com/blog/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-3-to-run-zynaddsubfx-in-a-headless-configuration/).

# Step 1. Setting up the OS

1. Download and burn [Raspberry pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) on a SD.
2. Enable ssh on the boot SD card by doing 

```
```

```
sudo apt-get install git cmake ccmake autotools node
git clone pi-synths

git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git nvm
nvm/install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
``
